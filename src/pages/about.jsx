          <h1>The creative industry is Not Only about graphic design</h1>
          <p>
            Letâ€™s be honest, there's endless content available on what it takes
            to be a Graphic Designer with interviews, talks, events and awards
            left right and centre.
          </p>
          <p>
            But as Graphic Design graduates eager to get started at an agency,
            we quickly realised that the creative industry is Not Only full of
            Graphic Designers, But Also tonnes of other roles. Ones that we had
            never even heard of before; Copywriters, Coders, Client Services,
            Strategists, UX, UI and Motion Designers, and so many more.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was where we came unstuck, asking ourselves; What do these
            people actually do? How did they end up here? Do I want to do that?
            Do I even actually want to be a Graphic Designer?
          </p>
          <p>Thatâ€™s why we created Not Only â€” But Also.</p>
          <h2>What is Not Only â€” But Also</h2>
          <p>
            Not Only â€” But Also is here to help people understand these roles
            and maybe even help them find where they fit. We want to open the
            conversation around the design industry in order to create new
            opportunities for young creatives looking for their first move.
          </p>
          <p>
            Weâ€™ll be answering some of the big questions by speaking directly to
            the people who do these roles day in, day out. With features,
            interviews and talks weâ€™ll share top insights from the people who
            know them best.
          </p>
          <p>
            We donâ€™t yet know all these answers ourselves, so this is a learning
            curve for us as much as you!
